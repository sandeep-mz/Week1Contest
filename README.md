# Weekly Contest Report - Beagle Blog Project
# Introduction
In this week's contest at Beagle Blog Project, I successfully completed a task that involved creating my first HTML project. 
The objective was to build a web page with specific requirements related to HTML structure, styling, and content layout.

# Task Description
The task involved creating an HTML page with a user interface based on a design provided in Figma. 
The main components of the task were as follows:

# HTML Structure
Added the necessary head tags including a suitable title, favicon, and linked the stylesheet.

# User Interface
Created a layout with three distinct sections:
- Topmost div: Designed as per the provided Figma design, including bold and italic text formatting.
- Image section: Displayed an image related to the Beagle breed, with the ability to replace the image while keeping the image source linked to the Beagle breed.
- Trivia section: Formatted as an ordered list, containing key points about the Beagle breed.
- Read More Link: Implemented a "Read More" link within the topmost div that directs users to the Wikipedia page for the Beagle breed.

# Challenges Overcome
While completing the task, I encountered a few challenges, including ensuring accurate replication of the Figma design and linking the image source correctly. However, by carefully reviewing the instructions and utilizing my HTML and CSS knowledge, I managed to overcome these challenges effectively.

# Lessons Learned
This contest was a great opportunity for me to apply my HTML and CSS skills practically. It reinforced my understanding of creating structured and visually appealing web pages. Additionally, I learned the importance of attention to detail when replicating design elements accurately.

# Conclusion
Participating in this weekly contest at XYZ Project was both educational and rewarding. It allowed me to enhance my web development skills, specifically in the context of HTML and CSS, while creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing web page based on the provided design. I look forward to further challenges and opportunities for learning and growth in future contests.
